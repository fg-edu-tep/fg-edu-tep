# 👋 Welcome!

This is **my alternate GitHub account**, primarily used **for university projects**.

🔗 **Looking for my main account?** Find me here: [github.com/fgutep](https://github.com/fgutep)

📚 Most of my academic work and personal projects are hosted there.

📝 Soon, my website ([fgutep.xyz](https://fgutep.xyz)) will host more information about my current projects and what I'm working on.

📂 Here, you can find some old labs, projects, and notes that can also be found on a public Obsidian garden based on "Webpage HTML export."

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
